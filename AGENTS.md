# Agent Orientation

This repo is both a working agent plugin and a testbed for a theory of how language shapes model behavior. Before changing skills, stances, agents, instructions, or hooks, read:

- [FOUNDATIONS.md](FOUNDATIONS.md) for the underlying model: probability landscapes, stances, information boundaries, and why skill text creates behavioral wells.
- [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) for the practical writing principles that follow from that model.

These files are not background reading. They explain the local definition of a good skill: a skill should shape how the agent thinks about the work, not merely list steps. Prefer honest descriptions of tensions, visible execution shape, and reinforcing stances over defensive rule lists.

When adding or editing repo artifacts:

- Inspect nearby artifacts first and preserve the established source-of-truth flow.
- Keep platform-specific packaging generated through the build system when possible.
- Use `pnpm validate` for resource/frontmatter checks.
- Use target builds such as `pnpm build:codex` or `pnpm package-codex` when changing packaged output.
